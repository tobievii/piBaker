Recipes for PI and IoT - All kinds of awesome projects with ingredients   


Requirements  
- Get latest Raspbian IMG from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ 
- Get PiBakery from https://github.com/davidferguson/pibakery/releases 

Open my recipes and start baking IoT!

Using Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (first boot needs ethernet internet connection there after you can wifi connect)

Takes Approximitly 1.5 hours to fully install and complete bootup, just use pi bakery and recipe , plug in and wait for completed 

NB Very important to NOT restart the PI while in mid setup as the script ONLY runs 1 time on boot. If you loose power or restart you will need to insert SD card in pc and update the PI Recipe again for next boot
